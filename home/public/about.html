                    My name is Kelsey Williams and I am a software developer out of Vista California. In highschool, I taught myself JavaScript and Python before earning a GED. I then enrolled in Palomar College and am working on my BS in Computer Science. At Palomar, I worked as a STEM tutor for a semester tutoring Calculus and Computer Science.

                    You can check it all out at my github, <a href="https://github.com/kelseywilliams">github.com/kelseywilliams</a>. Most of the repositories have readmes and at least some documentation.
